# SimpleDesktop  

A simple and easy to use configuration for awesomeWM.
It brings an UI-short user experience with a run dialog, conky settings, start view and tab switcher.
No annoying UI parts from the window manager that takes up space. 
It's just the user and his application(s).

Also available with a pre-built ISO image running ArchLinux and a set of pre-installed tools.
